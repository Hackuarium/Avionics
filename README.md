# Avionics
Electronic design of an avionics for mini rockets.
## Goals
- Monitor flight data
  - Acceleration X,Y,Z
  - Rotation X,Y,Z
  - Pressure (for altitude)
  - Video
- Start separation sequence

## Setup
On top of an ESP32C3 board connect an **Extension Board**
## Extension board for ESP32C3 (Micro Controler = µC)


- Connect all the ports from the ESP to the extension board (with pin header ?)
- LED donnected to a random port for test (BLINK - also alow to see if µC bugging or lagging)
- Communication I2C with µC
- Battery powered. Option ot charge just before launch (batery parck, umbilical external connector)?
- Switch to turn ON and OFF ? Access from outside the rocket.

## Ideas
- Battery voltage
